    "text": "Corsi and Fenwick\nCorsi can be explained as shot attempts. This includes the sum of shots on goal, missed shots, and blocked shots. It can be measured for a team or a player. Most commonly, Corsi is used to approximate shot attempt differential, which can be used as an indication of future goal differentials. If a team or player has high Corsi, they are creating more chances than their opponents, which should result in a higher goal differential over time. Most players have a “Corsi For” percentage (percent of shots for their team, compared to their opponent) between 40 and 60. A player or team ranked above 55% is often considered elite [1].\nFenwick, also known as “unblocked shot attempts”, is a variant of Corsi that only counts shots on goal and missed shots; it does not include blocked shots. It is generally viewed as having a stronger correlation to scoring chances. By itself, it is less reliable than Corsi, but it is the foundation of most Expected Goals models, which will be explained later [1]."

    "section": "PDO",
    "text": "PDO\nSimply, PDO is the sum of a team’s shooting percentage (offensifve goals scored divided by total shots for) and save percentage (shots saved divided by total shots against), multiplied by 10. Most teams should expect a PDO of around 100. PDO is often viewed as a measure of how “lucky” a team is [2]. For example, if a team has more goals scored on fewer shots, this could be interpreted as the team getting lucky with these goals; their shooting percentage would increase, resulting in a PDO greater than 100, reflecting this luck."

    "text": "Expected Goals\nExpected goals, abbreviated as xG, is an attempt to give each shot attempt value, depending on its location and type [3]. For example, a shot from the front of the net might get a score of 0.3, whereas a shot from the blueline might only get a score of 0.02. Generally, models will also factor in the situation of the game, such as if the shot is off a rebound or a rush [4]. Essentially, xG can be viewed as a form of Corsi that values each shot differently. This is not an exact science, and there are many different xG models, such as the model from Evolving Hockey [5]. The variable importances in Figure 1 show how each shot is measured for its contribution of the expected goals score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Evolving Hockey Expected Goals Model, Variable Importance"

This is calculated as the expected goals against minus the actual number of goals the goalie has let in. A positive number means the goalie is stopping more goals than an average goalie would [6]."
